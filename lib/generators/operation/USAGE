Description:
    Generates CRUD operations, along with a controller, views and an entry in the route file

Example:
    bin/rails generate operation User

    This will create:
        app/operations/user/load.rb
        app/operations/user/create.rb
        app/operations/user/update.rb
        app/operations/user/destroy.rb

        app/controllers/users_controller.rb

        app/views/users/index.html.haml
        app/views/users/show.html.haml
        app/views/users/new.html.haml
        app/views/users/edit.html.haml

    And add a routing entry:
        resources :users
